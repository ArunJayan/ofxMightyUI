a mini ui library for openframeworks. 
-------------------------------------


first things first: 
currently this is not usable by anyone but me, i guess. 
all code is released under the wtfpl: 
http://sam.zoy.org/wtfpl/

in the long run this is supposed to be a very very small 
ui library that runs cross-platform (mac os+ios at least)
with multitouch support. 

the library aims to only provide a minimal set of elements 
needed for basic interactive artworks:
sliders, segmented controls, buttons, labels, 
toolbars/navigation bars, internal windows, textfields

there's no intention to ever add more complex widgets than that, 
if that's what you need this library is not for you.
