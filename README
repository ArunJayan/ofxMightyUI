a mini ui library for openframeworks. 
-------------------------------------


first things first: 
this is very much a work in progress. the following sorta works: 
- windows (draggable, with titles and optional left/right toolbar buttons)
- labels (with all sorts of alignments)
- sliders (multitouch enabled, optionally with value labels)
- buttons
- textfields (operating system textfield is overlayed during editing so it allows copy&paste)
- scrollpanes
it's all butt ugly though. also eventually slow!

the rest is released under the wtfpl:

in the long run this is supposed to be a very very small 
ui library that runs cross-platform (mac os+ios at least)
with multitouch support. 

the library aims to only provide a minimal set of elements 
needed for basic interactive artworks:
sliders, segmented controls, buttons, labels, 
toolbars/navigation bars, internal windows, textfields

the library is  (and most likely won't be suitable)
as neither a proper gui replacement or as a scenegraph. 
there's already lots of other people doing that.
