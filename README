a mini ui library for openframeworks. 
-------------------------------------


first things first: 
this is very much a work in progress. the following sorta works: 
- windows 
- sliders 
- buttons
it's all butt ugly though. also slow!

the rest is released under the wtfpl:

in the long run this is supposed to be a very very small 
ui library that runs cross-platform (mac os+ios at least)
with multitouch support. 

the library aims to only provide a minimal set of elements 
needed for basic interactive artworks:
sliders, segmented controls, buttons, labels, 
toolbars/navigation bars, internal windows, textfields

the library is  (and most likely won't be suitable)
as neither a proper gui replacement or as a scenegraph. 
there's already lots of other people doing that.
